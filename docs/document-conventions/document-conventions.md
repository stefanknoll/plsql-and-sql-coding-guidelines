This document describes rules and recommendations for developing applications using the PL/SQL & SQL Language.

## Scope

This document applies to the PL/SQL and SQL language as used within ORACLE databases and tools, which access ORACLE databases.

## SQALE

SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations) is a method to support the evaluation of a software application source code. It is a generic method, independent of the language and source code analysis tools.

### SQALE characteristics and subcharacteristics

### Severity of the rule

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Will or may result in a bug.

!!! danger "Critical"
    Will have a high/direct impact on the maintenance cost.

!!! warning "Major"
    Will have a medium/potential impact on the maintenance cost.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Will have a low impact on the maintenance cost.

!!! info "Info"
    Very low impact; it is just a remediation cost report.
