# G-2340: Always define your VARCHAR2 variables using CHAR SEMANTIC (if not defined anchored).

!!! tip "Minor"
    Reliability

## Reason

Changes to `NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS` will only be picked up by your code after a recompilation.

In a multibyte environment a `VARCHAR2(50)` definition may not necessarily hold 50 characters, when multibyte characters a part of the value that should be stored unless the definition was done using the char semantic.

Additionally, <a href="https://carsandcode.com/2019/01/14/names-can-be-up-to-50-bytes-in-length/" target="_blank"> business users never say last names should be 50 bytes in length</a>.

## Example (bad)

```sql
create or replace package types is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200);
end types;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
create or replace package types is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200 char);
end types;
/
```
