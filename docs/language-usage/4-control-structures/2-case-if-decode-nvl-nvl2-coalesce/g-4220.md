# G-4220: Try to use CASE rather than DECODE.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Portability

## Reason

`DECODE` is an ORACLE specific function that can be hard to understand (particularly when not formatted well) and is restricted to SQL only. The `CASE` function is much more common has a better readability and may be used within PL/SQL too.

## Example (bad)

```sql
select decode(dummy, 'x', 1 
                   , 'y', 2
                   , 'z', 3
                        , 0)
  from dual;
```

## Example (good)

```sql
select case dummy
          when 'x' then 1
          when 'y' then 2
          when 'z' then 3
          else 0
       end
  from dual;
```
