# G-7510: Always prefix ORACLE supplied packages with owner schema name.

!!! warning "Major"
    Security

## Reason

The signature of oracle-supplied packages is well known and therefore it is quite easy to provide packages with the same name as those from oracle doing something completely different without you noticing it.

## Example (bad)

```sql
declare
   k_hello_world constant string(11 char) := 'Hello World';
begin
   dbms_output.put_line(k_hello_world);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
declare
   k_hello_world constant string(11 char) := 'Hello World';
begin
   sys.dbms_output.put_line(k_hello_world);
end;
/
```
