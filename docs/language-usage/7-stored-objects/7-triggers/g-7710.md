# G-7710: Avoid cascading triggers.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Testability

## Reason

Having triggers that act on other tables in a way that causes triggers on that table to fire lead to obscure behavior. 

Note that the example below is an anti-pattern as Flashback Data Archive should be used for row history instead of history tables.

## Example (bad)

```sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update on department for each row
begin
   insert into department_hist (department_id
                                ,department_name
                                ,manager_id
                                ,location_id
                                ,modification_date) 
        values (:old.department_id
               ,:old.department_name
               ,:old.manager_id
               ,:old.location_id
               ,sysdate);
end;
/ 
create or replace trigger dept_hist_br_i
before insert on department_hist for each row
begin
   insert into department_log (department_id
                               ,department_name
                               ,modification_date) 
                        values (:new.department_id
                               ,:new.department_name
                               ,sysdate);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)
Note: Again, don't use triggers to maintain history, use Flashback Data Archive instead.

```sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update on department for each row
begin
   insert into department_hist (department_id
                                ,department_name
                                ,manager_id
                                ,location_id
                                ,modification_date) 
        values (:old.department_id
               ,:old.department_name
               ,:old.manager_id
               ,:old.location_id
               ,sysdate);

   insert into department_log (department_id
                               ,department_name
                               ,modification_date) 
                        values (:old.department_id
                               ,:old.department_name
                               ,sysdate);

end;
/
```
