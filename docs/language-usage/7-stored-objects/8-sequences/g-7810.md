# G-7810: Never use SQL inside PL/SQL to read sequence numbers (or SYSDATE).

!!! warning "Major"
    Efficiency, Maintainability

## Reason

Since ORACLE 11g it is no longer needed to use a SELECT statement to read a sequence (which would imply a context switch).

## Example (bad)

```sql
declare
   l_sequence_number employees.emloyee_id%type;
begin
   select employees_seq.nextval
     into l_sequence_number
     from dual;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
declare
   l_sequence_number employees.emloyee_id%type;
begin
   l_sequence_number := employees_seq.nextval;
end;
/
```
