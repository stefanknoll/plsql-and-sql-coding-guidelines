# G-4110: Always use %NOTFOUND instead of NOT %FOUND to check whether a cursor returned data.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

The readability of your code will be higher when you avoid negative sentences.

## Example (bad)

```sql
declare
   cursor employee_cur is 
      select last_name
            ,first_name
        from employee
       where commission_pct is not null;
           
   r_employee  employee_cur%rowtype;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   
   <<read_employees>>
   loop
      fetch employee_cur into r_employee;
      exit read_employees when not employee_cur%found;
   end loop read_employees;
   
   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
declare
   cursor employee_cur is 
      select last_name
            ,first_name
        from employee
       where commission_pct is not null;
           
   r_employee  employee_cur%rowtype;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   
   <<read_employees>>
   loop
      fetch employee_cur into r_employee;
      exit read_employees when employee_cur%notfound;
   end loop read_employees;
   
   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```
