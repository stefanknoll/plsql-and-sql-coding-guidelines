# G-4120: Avoid using %NOTFOUND directly after the FETCH when working with BULK OPERATIONS and LIMIT clause. 

!!! danger "Critical"
    Reliability

## Reason

`%notfound` is set to `true` as soon as less than the number of rows defined by the `limit` clause has been read.

## Example (bad)

The employee table holds 107 rows. The example below will only show 100 rows as the cursor attribute `notfound` is set to true as soon as the number of rows to be fetched defined by the limit clause is not fulfilled anymore.

```sql
declare
   cursor employee_cur is 
      select *
        from employee
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employee_type is table of employee_cur%rowtype;
   t_employee t_employee_type;
   k_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch employee_cur bulk collect into t_employee limit k_bulk_size;
      exit process_employees when employee_cur%notfound;

      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employee.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employee(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
   end loop process_employees;

   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```

## Example (better)

This example will show all 107 rows but execute one fetch too much (12 instead of 11).

```sql
declare
   cursor employee_cur is 
      select *
        from employee
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employee_type is table of employee_cur%rowtype;
   t_employee t_employee_type;
   k_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch employee_cur bulk collect into t_employee limit k_bulk_size;
      exit process_employees when t_employee.count() = 0;
      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employee.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employee(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
   end loop process_employees;
   
   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

This example does the trick (11 fetches only to process all rows)

```sql
declare
   cursor employee_cur is 
      select *
        from employee
       order by employee_id;

   type t_employee_type is table of employee_cur%rowtype;
   t_employee t_employee_type;
   k_bulk_size constant simple_integer := 10;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      fetch employee_cur bulk collect into t_employee limit k_bulk_size;
      <<display_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employee.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employee(i).last_name);
      end loop display_employees;
      exit process_employees when t_employee.count() <> k_bulk_size;
   end loop process_employees;
   
   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```
