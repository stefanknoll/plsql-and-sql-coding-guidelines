# G-4140: Avoid executing any statements between a SQL operation and the usage of an implicit cursor attribute.

!!! warning "Major"
    Reliability

## Reason

Oracle provides a variety of cursor attributes (like `%found` and `%rowcount`) that can be used to obtain information about the status of a cursor, either implicit or explicit. 

You should avoid inserting any statements between the cursor operation and the use of an attribute against that cursor. Interposing such a statement can affect the value returned by the attribute, thereby potentially corrupting the logic of your program. 

In the following example, a procedure call is inserted between the DELETE statement and a check for the value of `sql%rowcount`, which returns the number of rows modified by that last SQL statement executed in the session. If this procedure includes a `commit` / `rollback` or another implicit cursor the value of `sql%rowcount` is affected.


## Example (bad)

```sql
create or replace package body employee_api as
   k_one constant simple_integer := 1;
   
   procedure process_dept(in_dept_id in departments.department_id%type) is
   begin
      null;
   end process_dept;
      
   procedure remove_employee (in_employee_id in employee.employee_id%type) is
      l_dept_id      employee.department_id%type;
   begin
      delete from employee
       where employee_id = in_employee_id
       returning department_id into l_dept_id;

      process_dept(in_dept_id => l_dept_id);
      
      if sql%rowcount > k_one then
         -- too many rows deleted. 
         rollback;
      end if;
   end remove_employee;
end employee_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
create or replace package body employee_api as
   k_one constant simple_integer := 1;
   
   procedure process_dept(in_dept_id in departments.department_id%type) is
   begin
      null;
   end process_dept;
      
   procedure remove_employee (in_employee_id in employee.employee_id%type) is
      l_dept_id      employee.department_id%type;
      l_deleted_emps simple_integer;
   begin
      delete from employee
       where employee_id = in_employee_id
       returning department_id into l_dept_id;

      l_deleted_emps := sql%rowcount;

      process_dept(in_dept_id => l_dept_id);
      
      if l_deleted_emps > k_one then
         -- too many rows deleted. 
         rollback;
      end if;
   end remove_employee;
end employee_api;
/
```
