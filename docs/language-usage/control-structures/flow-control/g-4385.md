# G-4385: Never use a cursor for loop to check whether a cursor returns data.

!!! warning "Major"
    Efficiency

## Reason

You might process more data than required, which leads to bad performance.

Also, check out rule [G-8110: Never use SELECT COUNT(\*) if you are only interested in the existence of a row.](/docs/4-language-usage/8-patterns/1-checking-the-number-of-rows/g-8110.md)

## Example (bad)

```sql
declare
   l_employee_found boolean := false;
   cursor employee_cur is
      select employee_id, last_name
        from employee;
   r_employee employee_cur%rowtype;     
begin
   <<check_employees>>
   for r_employee in employee_cur
   loop
      l_employee_found := true;
   end loop check_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
declare
   l_employee_found boolean := false;
   cursor employee_cur is
      select employee_id, last_name
        from employee;
   r_employee employee_cur%rowtype;
begin
   open employee_cur;
   fetch employee_cur into r_employee;
   l_employee_found := employee_cur%found;
   close employee_cur;
end;
/
```
