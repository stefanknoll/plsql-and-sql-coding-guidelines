# G-7110: Try to use named notation when calling program units.

!!! warning "Major"
    Changeability, Maintainability

## Reason

Named notation makes sure that changes to the signature of the called program unit do not affect your call.

This is not needed for standard functions like (`to_char`, `to_date`, `nvl`, `round`, etc.) but should be followed for any other stored object having more than one parameter.

## Example (bad)

```sql
declare
   r_employee employee%rowtype;
   k_id constant employee.employee_id%type := 107;
begin
   employee_api.employee_by_id(r_employee, k_id);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

```sql
declare
   r_employee employee%rowtype;
   k_id constant employee.employee_id%type := 107;
begin
   employee_api.employee_by_id(out_row => r_employee, in_employee_id => k_id);
end;
/
```
