# G-7720: Avoid triggers for business logic
 
!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency, Maintainability

## Reason

When business logic is part of a trigger, it becomes obfuscated. In general, maintainers don't look for code in a trigger.
More importantly, if the code on the trigger does SQL or worse PL/SQL access, this becomes a context switch or even a nested loop that could significantly affect performance.
